This is in the [ideation phase](https://bitclout.com/u/SpaceClout), but basically I want to potentially make aeronautical engineering projects that connect to BitClout. How you ask? Well the first project I am looking towards building is deploying some sort of makeshift cubesat that connects to a BitClout node. Watch the video on the top to see my awkward pitch :)
